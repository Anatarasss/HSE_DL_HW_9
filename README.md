# Generating Human Faces with Adversarial Networks

This project demonstrates the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate realistic human faces. The goal is to train a neural network to produce plausible human faces, capturing various aspects such as appearance, expression, and accessories.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following key components:
1. **Data Loading**: Uses the LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) dataset to fetch and preprocess human face images.
2. **Generator Network**: A neural network that generates face images from random noise.
3. **Discriminator Network**: A neural network that distinguishes between real and generated faces.
4. **Training Loop**: Alternates between training the discriminator and the generator to improve both networks iteratively.
5. **Evaluation**: Visualizes generated images and evaluates the performance of the GAN.
